# JavaScript Password Generator

## Description
I was tasked by the client to create a program that would generate a random password based on multiple criteria:

- To give the user a prompt how long the password should be (between 10 and 64 characters)

- To give the user prompts on if it should have lowercase, uppercase, numbers or special characters. It must have had at least one of these.

- In built validation that would detect if incorrect data types were entered

## Challenges Faced

### Where to Start?

At the start, I felt quite confident. I had all these ideas, but once the code was on the screen, I felt like I wasn't quite sure what problem I should tackle next. Every week I'm understanding even more how important it is to be organised with your code.

### Messy but Functional

Like most of the code I'm writing at the moment, it seems to be messy, but also scalable and functionable.
As I learn more algorithms and develop my problem solving, I'll become more efficent. 

I felt like it got a bit function bloated at times, and at one point I was completely overwhelmed by my own code. I need to look into finding ways to making my code much more readable and understandable when it becomes bigger. 

## For Next Time

On my previous project, I came to the conclusion that I needed to use far more functions to make my code more readable and easier to read. I did that here, but found it to get a bit overwhelming when I was at 200 lines of code. Will look to explorer new ways to lay out my functions. 


## Installation
